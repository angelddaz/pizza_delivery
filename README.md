# pizza_delivery

This repos will be for my pizza delivery data analysis and statistics. 
This is where I tackle simple questions to learn more about statistics and Python with a dataset 
I collected and know very well - my pizza delivery data!

The Jupyter notebooks are much more interesting than the scripts on here. They have code, comments,
analysis, jokes (huh), and most important of all, pictures!

It is 1301 rows of deliveries which I collected, with the help of my wife (she was also a
delivery driver), by hand. I then input the data into excel over a few months and now am
able to tackle projects using this interesting record of my life.

So far there is only a portion of my work uploaded. I want to make sure I properly comment 
and clean it up before I upload the rest.
